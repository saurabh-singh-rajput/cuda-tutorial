# CUDA Programming Learning Resource

Welcome to the CUDA Programming Learning Resource! This repository is a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to learn CUDA programming from scratch. It contains a single Google Colab notebook that outlines concepts and provides executable code examples to help you grasp the fundamentals of CUDA and parallel computing with NVIDIA GPUs.

## What is CUDA?

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows software developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose processing (an approach termed GPGPU, General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units).

## About the Notebook

The included Google Colab notebook is a living document that will evolve as I continue my journey of learning CUDA. It is structured to facilitate both theoretical learning and practical application, ensuring that you can understand and apply CUDA concepts effectively.

### Features

- **Conceptual Overviews**: Each section begins with a theoretical explanation of the underlying CUDA concepts. I will try to keep this crisp and short, with some additional reading reading list.
- **Code Examples**: Followed by practical code examples that you can run directly in Google Colab.
- **Progressive Complexity**: The notebook starts with basic examples and gradually introduces more complex scenarios.
- **Interactive Learning**: Since it's a Colab notebook, you can execute the code and see the results immediately.

## How to Use This Repository

To make the most out of this resource, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the notebook to your local machine.
2. **Open in Colab**: Upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and open it.
3. **Read and Execute**: Go through the text explanations and execute the code cells as you progress.
4. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code and experiment with your own examples.

## Table of Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to CUDA and Parallel Computing
2. Setting Up the CUDA Environment
3. CUDA Memory Management
4. Writing Your First CUDA Kernel
5. Understanding Execution Configuration
6. Optimizing CUDA Applications
7. Advanced CUDA Features
8. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into this notebook, make sure you have:

- A basic understanding of programming (preferably in C/C++)
- Access to a system with an NVIDIA GPU for the best experience (not mandatory as Google Colab provides a GPU)

## Contributing

This project is a living state and hence would be updated as I go on learning the concepts myself. It's open to contributions! If you have suggestions, corrections, or content to add, please make a pull request or open an issue.
